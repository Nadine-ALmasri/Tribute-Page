        <p id="tribute-info">Magdi Yacoub is one of the world's most respected cardiac surgeons. Born in Egypt, he
            decided early on that he wanted to become a doctor and help others. He studied medicine at Cairo University
            and thereafter moved to the U.K. Most of his innovations and pioneering work in the field of heart surgery
            came during his stint in the hospitals in U.K. He is well known for his innovations in tissue engineering,
            myocardial regeneration, and transplant immunology. He has not only been a top-rated heart surgeon, but has
            also given back to the next generation of doctors as a professor at the prestigious Imperial College in
            London. He has written over 1,000 articles and co-authored several books on the heart surgery techniques he
            has developed. He has also founded a children's charity called ‘Chain of Hope’, in order to help children in
            war-torn and developing countries receive much needed cardiac care. When not practicing medicine, he likes
            to spend time with his family which includes his wife Marianne, and their three grown children.</p>
        <p id="tribute-info">As one of the world's leading cardiac surgeons, he pioneered techniques that include
            tissue engineering heart valves, novel left ventricular assist devices, and wireless sensors for heart
            patients. In addition, he developed a procedure for switching heart vessels of babies born with congenital
            heart defects.</p>
